  {
    icon: Shield, issue: "DDoS attacks on origin", solution: "Prolexic + Site Shield", products: ["Prolexic", "Site Shield"],
    steps: [
      "Enable Prolexic (Akamai's dedicated DDoS protection product) — traffic routes through Akamai's scrubbing centers that detect and filter volumetric, protocol, and app-layer attacks. Unlike WAF which handles application-layer threats like SQL injection, Prolexic specifically handles large-scale network floods (e.g. 10+ Tbps volumetric attacks)",
      "Activate Site Shield — real origin IPs masked behind Akamai edge. Block non-Akamai traffic via firewall ACLs",
      "Configure drop thresholds for obvious attacks — >10,000 req/sec from single IP, >1M req/min from single /16 subnet",
      "mPulse monitors origin health and attack traffic — track dropped traffic, origin response time, incident timeline",
    ],
    result: "10+ Tbps attack capacity absorbed at edge, origin stays online, attackers can't find real infrastructure",
    bestPractice: "Enable Site Shield Day 1 to hide origin IPs — this single step prevents most direct-to-origin attacks",
  },
  {
    icon: AlertTriangle, issue: "Legacy WAF rules outdated", solution: "App & API Protector (AAP) — Adaptive Security Engine", products: ["App & API Protector (AAP)"],
    steps: [
      "Audit current WAF rules — identify outdated signatures missing OWASP Top 10 coverage (injection, broken authentication [e.g. session hijacking, weak password policies], data exposure)",
      "Enable AAP (App & API Protector — Akamai's next-gen WAF) managed rules — auto-updating daily based on global attack trends, new malware, CVEs, zero-days",
      "Deploy reputation-based rules — Akamai tracks attacker IP behavior globally and blocks known sources automatically",
      "7-day tuning window — deploy AAP in Alert mode first (logs threats but doesn't block), review flagged requests for false positives, then switch to Deny mode once confident rules won't block legitimate traffic",
    ],
    result: "Modern attack coverage, zero manual rule updates, 5x fewer false positives vs legacy WAF",
    bestPractice: "Use Adaptive Security Engine auto-tuning — 7-day alert-only baseline before switching to deny mode",
  },
  {
    icon: UserX, issue: "Credential stuffing surge", solution: "Bot Manager Premier + EdgeWorkers + Rate Limiting", products: ["Bot Manager Premier", "EdgeWorkers", "AAP"],
    steps: [
      "Deploy Bot Manager on login endpoints — it analyzes 100+ behavioral signals to distinguish bots from humans. Examples: mouse movement patterns (bots move in straight lines or don't move at all), keystroke timing (bots type at inhuman speed with zero variance), device fingerprints (bots often have mismatched browser/OS combinations)",
      "Use EdgeWorkers to inject custom challenge logic at the edge — run JavaScript that validates request signatures, enforces proof-of-work challenges, or injects honeypot fields before requests ever reach origin",
      "Detect stuffing signatures — rapid-fire failed logins (e.g. 50 attempts/second), retry timing patterns identical to known bot frameworks, geographic mismatches (same account attempted from 10 countries in 1 minute)",
      "Enforce adaptive challenges — legitimate users pass once (device fingerprint stored), bot requests get progressively harder challenges",
      "Integrate with customer's account system — lock accounts after 5 failed attempts, trigger 2FA for suspicious logins",
    ],
    result: "99% of credential stuffing blocked before origin sees it, zero legitimate user friction",
    bestPractice: "Start Bot Manager in monitoring mode for 48-72 hours to classify bot categories before enforcement",
  },
  {
    icon: ShoppingCart, issue: "Inventory scraping by competitive bots", solution: "Bot Manager Behavioral Fingerprinting", products: ["Bot Manager Premier"],
    steps: [
      "Enable Bot Manager on catalog endpoints — IP blocks fail because scrapers rotate proxies. Focus on behavior instead",
      "Identify scraper patterns — perfect request timing, missing headers, identical User-Agent across 100+ IPs, sequential product enumeration",
      "Fingerprint devices — TLS analysis, JavaScript execution tests, cookie handling. Same fingerprint across 50 IPs = scraper",
      "Rate limit suspicious fingerprints to 10 req/min vs 1,000 for real users. Force CAPTCHA on first request",
    ],
    result: "Scrapers blocked by behavior not IP, competitive intel loss ends, inventory data stays proprietary",
    bestPractice: "Use crypto challenges instead of CAPTCHAs — invisible to legitimate users, impossible for bots to solve",
  },
  {
    icon: CreditCard, issue: "Carding on checkout APIs", solution: "AAP Rate Limiting + Bot Manager", products: ["AAP", "Bot Manager Premier"],
    steps: [
      "Instrument checkout endpoints — AAP learns normal API usage: 1 card validation per 30s per user, <5 card attempts per session",
      "Detect carding patterns — rapid-fire card validations, 50 different cards with same CVV, geographic jumps in seconds",
      "Block & notify — block transaction immediately, flag account, send fraud signal to payment processor",
      "Force step-up authentication for flagged transactions — re-enter CVV, OTP verification, blacklist card fingerprints",
    ],
    result: "Carding success rate drops to 0.01%, payment processor alerted before chargebacks",
    bestPractice: "Apply positive security model with schema validation — only allow expected API parameter formats through",
  },
  {
    icon: Bot, issue: "Sophisticated bot evasion (IP rotation, spoofed clients)", solution: "Bot Manager ML Fingerprinting + Behavioral Analysis", products: ["Bot Manager Premier"],
    steps: [
      "Build behavioral baseline — track real Chrome behavior: TLS cipher order, JA3 fingerprints, JS engine behavior, cookie handling",
      "Deploy ML fingerprinting — compare incoming requests against baseline. Spoofed User-Agent with rotating IPs still leaves traces",
      "Detect spoofed headers — bot spoofs Chrome but missing Chrome-specific header permutations or uses Firefox HTTP/2 SETTINGS",
      "Escalating enforcement — 1st offense: CAPTCHA, 2nd (same device, different IP): block 1h, 3rd: block 24h",
    ],
    result: "Spoofing one feature possible; spoofing 100 features across 1000 requests = impossible. Attack ROI becomes negative",
    bestPractice: "Behavioral analysis catches bots that rotate IPs and spoof User-Agents — signature-based solutions miss these entirely",
